## Introduction

A minimal "Hello, world" FOLIO module written in Java, inspired by the `hello-vertx` example. However, this example uses the Spring framework and OpenAPI. This module is intended as a minimal use case of these technologies as they are used in FOLIO modules.

The API is exactly that of `hello-vertx`, with a small caveat that it validates JSON that is posted in the request. To see the API specification, refer to
